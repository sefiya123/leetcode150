133. Clone Graph
Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.

Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.

class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}
 

Test case format:

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with val == 1, the second node with val == 2, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with val = 1. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.

 

Example 1:


Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).


```cpp
  Node *dfs(Node*cur,unordered_map<Node*,Node*>&mp) {
        vector<Node*>nghbr;
        Node* clone = new Node(cur->val);
        mp[cur] = clone;
        for(auto it: cur->neighbors){
                if(mp.find(it)!=mp.end()) {
                    nghbr.push_back(mp[it]);
                }
                else {
                    Node * ans = dfs(it,mp);
                    nghbr.push_back(ans);


                }
        }
        clone->neighbors = nghbr;
        return clone;
    } 
    Node* cloneGraph(Node* node) {
        unordered_map<Node*,Node*>mp;
        if (node == NULL){
            return NULL;
        }
        if(node->neighbors.size() == 0) {
            Node * clone = new Node(node->val);
            return clone;
        }
        return dfs(node,mp);
    }
};

141. Linked List Cycle

Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.

```cppp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    bool hasCycle(ListNode *head) {
        ListNode * slow = head;
        ListNode* fast = head;
        while(fast != NULL && fast->next!=NULL) {
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next->next;
            if(slow == fast) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

Time Complexity
Worst case: The slow pointer moves one step at a time, and the fast pointer moves two steps at a time.

In the absence of a cycle, the fast pointer reaches the end of the list in O(n) steps.

If there is a cycle, the pointers meet in at most O(n) steps (where n is the number of nodes in the list).

Therefore:

𝐶
=
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
TC=O(n)
Space Complexity
You only use two pointers (slow and fast), regardless of the list size.

No extra data structures are used.

Therefore:

𝐶
=
𝑂
(

)
SC=O(1)
✅ Final Answer:

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1)
